This is a README.md of Rory Coleman's JETS project.

# Overview

  - This homework was designed to implement all of the skills we have learned through 3 weeks.
  - I created a Jet super class and two different sub classes. These subclasses extended the Jet super class and also implemented an interface.


 Topics Covered:
  - Super & sub classes, lists, abstract classes, interfaces, Getters and setters, private fields, static fields, if statements, while loops, switches, for loops, for each loops, the concept of toString().

### Tech

I used the following on my project:

* [Eclipse] - IDE
* [GitHub] - Where i stored all of my code
* [Terminal] - What i used to push my code to GitHub
* [Zoom] - Teleconference software i used to communicate with instructors and fellow students
* [Slack] - Text based chat room, used to communicate with instructors and fellow students
* [Google] - Thank goodness for google
* [Stack Overflow] - I think this site helped...

#### Lessons Learned

Here are some lessons I learned or re-experienced:

* Be sure to review what i've written every "so often"
* Save your work, constantly
* Take breaks
* Check your work before asking for help
* Double check your work before asking for help
* Triple check your work before asking for help
